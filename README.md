[Go to Stretto](https://next.kaiserapps.com/), or if you would like to host it yourself, scroll down to the developer instructions.

## How does Stretto work?

Stretto works by backing every single one of your tracks with a video or song from youtube or soundcloud, and plays them transparently through an iframe embedded on the page.

Here is a list of some of the features Stretto has:

- [Import your playlists from Spotify](https://next.kaiserapps.com/spotify/)
- [Syncing between machines](https://next.kaiserapps.com/sync/) (by logging in with Google, PRs welcome for other auth methods)
- Automatic lyric fetching for the currently playing song
- [Music discovery through iTunes/Spotify top charts](https://next.kaiserapps.com/discover)
- Search iTunes and add tracks to library seamlessly
- Multiple themes available
- Completely free!
- [Android App](https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto-mobile-next/)
